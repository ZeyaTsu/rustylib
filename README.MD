# About rustylib's history and motivation
Rustylib (rusty) was first made as a fun project, spend time etc...<br/>
Indeed, at first I've just wanted to remake some built-in functions from scratch (random, requests, etc...) <br/>
but more time passed, the more I wanted to add my own extensions to it. <br/>
For now, I still have some ideas and extensions I want to add so let's go ! :) <br/>
